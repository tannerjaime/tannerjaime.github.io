            <p>The World Weather Modification Committee was founded in 2115, in a time when the water crisis was at it's peak and private weather modification tactics were rampant. Private cloud seeding was causing high levels of rainfalls in areas with more wealth and rain potential. Extrodinarily high levels of silver iodide, carbon dioxide and other chemicals used in the cloud seeding process where not only causining high levels of pollution, but making large amounts of rainfall less and less likely.</p>

            <p>This battle over water usage was deleterious to the worlds water sources as well. Contamination was increasing and acquifier levels were dropping dramatically. </p>

            <h2>Formation of the WWMC</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>In the fall of 2114, leaders from around the world gathered to discuss not only the water crisis, but also the overseeding that was occuring world wide. Members of the meeting agreed that if a lack of oversight continued, air pollution would worsen and the water resources would exponentially fall. They agreed to form an independant international organization in charge of overseeing all cloud seeding around the world, and the World Weather Modification Committee was born. </p>
            <hr>
            <p>The committee worked with scientists, leaders and community members to determine appropriate levels of cloud seeding depending on location and aquifer levels. After the first year of the committee's existance, rainfall increased in areas that had not seen rain in years, and aquifer levels were increasing. </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Today</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Today, the WWMC is still committed to ensuring safe, reliable rainfall around the world. With over 90 years of experience, the committee has grown from its humble beginnings as a councel to limit overseeding. The WWMC now has an official network of seed clouders around the world, and has a determined schedule of rainfall, ensuring maximum water reaches all areas in need. </p>
